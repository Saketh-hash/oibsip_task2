# Task 2: Advanced Password Generator

An **Advanced Password Generator** developed using Python's Tkinter library. This application allows users to generate secure and customizable passwords with a user-friendly graphical interface. 

## Features

- **Randomization**: Generates secure and unpredictable passwords using cryptographically strong random numbers.
- **User Input Validation**: Ensures that the password meets minimum length requirements (at least 8 characters).
- **Character Set Management**: Customizes the password generation process with options to include or exclude uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- **Interactive GUI**: Provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface.
- **Clipboard Integration**: Allows users to copy the generated password directly to the clipboard.
